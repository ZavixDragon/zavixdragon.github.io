All the highly successful programmers write blogs. You want to be a successful programmer don’t you? Do it for your confidence, do it for your craft, do it for your career, and do it for fun!

## You don’t know what the hell you are talking about, if you can’t write a post about it
----

Everyone claims to have skills. Heck! On their resumes people put the most obscure skills they can imagine themselves having. You can find script kiddies that think they know html because they modified a tumblr theme. The truth is revealed when someone writes and talks about it. That’s what blogs are all about, to present your opinions in written form.

After you write about something, you will speak and argue about it coming off as more credible. You want your company to listen when you tell them your ideas. You want your teammates to accept those ideas, don’t you? Then write about it!

## Keep learning and get good
----

This will improve your writing skills. For all those programmers who are saying “I just code, I don’t need to be good at writing”, unless you don't work on a team and you don’t have to communicate with your bosses, then the hell you don’t! I bet you correspond every day with the people you work with, and if you want people to say "YES!" to your design decisions and ideas, then git gud! 

 **The fastest way to learn where you're wrong is when you present ideas to be destroyed by other people.** Technical minds will be quick to criticize your ideas online, and this is exactly what you want. **Either you will defend those ideas and become more confident, or they will be burned and better ideas will rise from those ashes.**

You must always be learning new things to keep writing in your blog. This will encourage you to learn more and think more deeply about those topics.

## This is your future
----

Are you happy striving at your 8 hour job, driving through that traffic, making enough money to be okay, then just go on and skip this section.

I see that you want to be paid the big bucks, giving the talks, and signing copies of your book. This is the path that Yegor Bugayenko, Martin Fowler, Uncle Bob, and many other great programmers have taken. They all started blogging, and then found that they had many ideas to give so they wrote books and gave talks.

You are future writing your book. The concepts you write here will form into chapters in your best seller. They will be the concepts in the talks that you give. You will get to know the other great programmers and get invited to speak and contribute on important repositories.

## Conclusion
----

You will become confident, as you are blazing a trail ahead of you towards future success. It will make you good at writing, programming, and life. **Write a damn blog!**
